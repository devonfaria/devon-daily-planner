## Description

Welcome to the daily planner application that I created to help you save daily tasks. When you click the save button, the text input for the sibling textarea will be saved an object in localStorage for the window, so that whenever you load this application, it shows saved content.

## Visuals

The following layout is what you can expect to see on your browser.

This is what you page should look like if there is content in localStorage that has been saved previously.

A huge thank you to the UNCC Virtual Bootcamp for providing me with the knowledge to create such an intricate function, and the support to code it correctly!
